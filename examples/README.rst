This folder contains a few examples.

- example1.py is a very simple example showing how to perform reweighting using scalar couplings data. 
- example2.py shows how to produce the data to Figure 3A, C, D in the manuscript "Integrating Molecular Simulation and Experimental Data: a Bayesian/MaxEnt (BME) reweighting approach."
- example3.py shows how to produce the data for the plot 3C in the same manuscript.

A similar analysis is described in the two python notebooks.
